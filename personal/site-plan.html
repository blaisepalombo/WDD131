			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this website is to help users track their reading progress and organize their book collections. It allows readers to log books they’ve read, are currently reading, or plan to read, while offering features to filter and sort by genres or personal ratings. The site aims to create a simple yet interactive tool for book lovers to manage their reading journey.</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The intended audience for this website is book lovers and avid readers who want an easy way to track their reading habits and discover new books. It’s designed for anyone looking to organize their reading lists and stay motivated to read more.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I will use JavaScript to add dynamic elements like a search feature to filter books by genre or rating, and allow users to add, remove, or update their reading progress. Buttons will let users mark books as 'read,' and the site will show book recommendations based on user preferences.</p>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
